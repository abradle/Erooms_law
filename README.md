# Erooms_law

## Goal

In this notebook, I'll combine data from the yearly PhRMA report and the FDA's databases to check if the trajectory of Eroom's law has been affected by the introduction of machine learning to the biopharmaceutical ecosystem. 

## Final Plot

If you want to skip the code and see the results:

The trend certainly hasn't reversed but after the introduction of ML and especially DL, the trend seems to be decreasingly less stably.
